Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python 


1. In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development?
 If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

Answer 1 - 
Front-end is the part of a website users interact with. Buttons, links, forms, 
and animations are all created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Back-end handles data storage and business logic. It communicates with the 
database to store and retrieve user information. Tools like Python, PHP, 
JavaScript, and Ruby on Rails are used. For a back-end role, tasks may include 
working with databases, authentication, encryption, APIs, and data mapping.

2. Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future.
 Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice.
  How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team?
   Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 
(Hint: refer to the Exercise section “The Benefits of Developing with Python”)

Answer 2 -
Both JavaScript and Python are user-friendly high-level languages with dynamic 
typing. Python's standout feature is its exceptional readability, which becomes 
even more crucial as projects scale. This clarity ensures that as more developers 
join, the code remains accessible and supports effective collaboration.

Moreover, Python offers built-in package management and thrives within a dynamic 
community that diligently updates the language. This ongoing commitment guarantees 
its enduring relevance and adaptability to evolving technological landscapes.

3. Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement.
 You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you.
  What do you want to learn about Python? 
  What do you want to get out of this Achievement? 
  Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

Answer 3 -
I want to learn more about object-oriented programming..
I want to learn how to write scripts to automate tasks.
I want to enhance my backend skills.
